#import random library
import random
#Create a temperature variable, give it a value (random from 1 to 30).
Temp_var = random.randint(1, 30)
print(Temp_var)
#Make an if statement to see if temperature variable is above 20
#   - If yes, print it's hot
#   - If no, bring it to next if statement
if Temp_var > 20:
    print("its hot")
elif Temp_var > 10:
    print("its mild")
#Make an if statement to see if temperature variable is above 10
#   - If yes, print it's mild
#   - If no, print it's cold
if Temp_var < 10:
    print("it's cold")
#Print "Thank you!" and end the code
print("Thank you!")
